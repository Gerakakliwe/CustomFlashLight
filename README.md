# CustomFlashLight
First kotlin project!
I used this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HroF6s9KLo) as a source for this project

This is how it looks while turned off and on

I tested it on my physical Redmi note 9 and it works great with both, dark and light mode.

However, on my other device Poco X3 - it looks messed up when using in dark mode. I might return to that issue later.
